As a student learning about computer science, I encouter the many varieties of coding language. This semester I'm focusing on Javascript and it is interesting to learn about. I've previously learned how to code in Java in the beginning of my college life and now I can see many similarities between the two. For me, it feels like Javascript is easier to learn than other languages possibly because of my background with Java. Learning Javascript is very helpful and it feels like I will be able to use it in future careers. From what I've currently experienced Javascript seems very fun and a type of coding that I will be using after I complete ICS 314.

In class I do my best to complete the work given to me as best as I can. We are given a problem called "WOD" or "Workout of the Day". When I have WODs as homework I have lots of time to think about how to approach the problem and can come back to it before I have to turn in my final attempt. However, during class I feel a little stressed due to having a time limit and a small bit of anxiety to make sure that my code holds up. Due to COVID-19 classes have moved online and although for programming classes it won't affect the assignments as much, how teachers teach feels different. As teachers need to adjust so do the students and I feel like my experience with the class is a bit more stressful as being at home makes it harder for me to focus on working. Hopefully I will be able to pull through this class!

Overall, I have high expectations for Javascript. If anyone reading this is thinking about taking a class about Javascript I would recommend giving it a try!
