I am still considered a "newbie" in terms of software engineering. While I'm still taking classes on all the different kinds of coding language, I am happy to be able to create my own programs for fun. Software engineering allows me to create some program for the use of others. Starting with a small bit of coding to make a computer say "Hello World" and now to making a simple game like Flappy Bird. I hope to one day make a program that will make people's lives easier. 

##Developing an Interest

I first became interested in coding when I was in high school. I am an avid gamer and after playing many games, I began to start to wonder how I could make a game. My school didn't have much in terms of teaching computer coding, so when I started college I decided to try majoring in computer science. ICS 111 taught me about Java coding where I made my first leap in learning about coding. I made a few games which unfortunately were lost due to my old laptop breaking down. I am still working on bettering my understanding and my interest continues to grow.

##The Future

Learning all the skills needed to create efficient programs will take me a few more years, but I believe that I will still enjoy learning them. With the skills I have currently I could design or recreate some simple games and if I tried to expand my horizons maybe create a new unique game. As time moves forward there will be new techniques created to help people learn about coding and I hope that I'll be able to play a role in that some day. Maybe one day there will be a game that I made that becomes popular!
