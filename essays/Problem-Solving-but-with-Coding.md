## Have Problems? Maybe It's Been Solved.

Design patterns at it simplist are solutions that can be applied to many situations which are helpful to solving problems. They are usually designed to be efficient and are basically the "cheat codes" to coding. Although you have the codes, you have to have some knowledge on how to use them. Design pattens can still help who are starting off by giving them a layout on how to approach it. Visualizing many of the design patterns can be seen using a flow chart similar to the picture above. You can see your inputs and desired outputs and what you might need to use to create the code you want. 

## Using the Power of Design Patterns

Unknowlingly, I have already been using design patterns before even learning what a design pattern is. This is mainly due to how coding has been brought up to date which incorperates many design patterns to make more design patterns. A good example of this is Meteor as itself has many design patterns that were modernized. I often for class use a template created by my professor called meteor-application-template[https://ics-software-engineering.github.io/meteor-application-template-react/] to create my websites. The template itself could be considered a design pattern in the sense that it has a basic layout that I can freely manipulate to suit my needs. Then within the template I use Meteor which itself has a lot of the design patterns. One example is the Publish-Subscribe design pattern in Meteor. Simply put Publish-Subscribe can be used to view collections and restrict people who don't have access to certain collections.
