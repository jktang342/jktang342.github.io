I am still considered a "newbie" in terms of software engineering. While I'm still taking classes on all the different kinds of coding language, I am happy to be able to create my own programs for fun. Software engineering allows me to create some program for the use of others. Starting with a small bit of coding to make a computer say "Hello World" and now to making a simple game like Flappy Bird. I hope to one day make a program that will make people's lives easier.
