Everyone has different standards when it comes to coding. Whether people agree that there should be one or two spaces between your curly braces or if they should be on the next line is up  to them. Recently I've been using ESLint on IntelliJ as my current coding standard. I believe that everyone has a point in what coding should look like, but coding standards will always in the end follow a few rules that everyone agrees upon.

## Experiences with ESLint

On IntelliJ, I installed ESLint to help check my code is up to standards. Even though sometimes it's annoying to see that my spacing is off because I got used to writing a certain way, it shows me other ways to clean my code up. ESLint gives me new standards to learn and possibly will help to improve my own standards. Using these coding standards for class will overall be a great benefit for me. I have a feeling that I will be able to clean up my code even more after this semester is over. ESLint is beneficial to making sure that the format of my code is easy to view since everyone's screen has the potential to look different from mine.

## Why Coding Standards Are Important

If we didn't have these coding standards, then everyone would not understand each other's code. Although everyone has their own style to coding, for the most part someone else could read or adjust your code and know what it would do. Coding standards help teach people what to look out for and are important to keeping code clean. Clean code means it is easier to find out where problems could be. If people decided to forgo coding standards such as adding indentations in your code, then it becomes harder for anyone including the creator to tweak their code. I believe that coding standards help to improve the overall quality since it helps everyone in the end. Although it would be nice to be able to make code look crazy, you always have to think about if you need to go back to fix something or if you need help, will you be able to know what you previously created?
