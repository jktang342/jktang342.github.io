summary: Learning and teaching about raids in Destiny 2.
---

Destiny 2 is a "shooter-looter" game which means that it's a game that uses guns, but has an open world aspect. In Destiny 2 there is player versus player (PVP) content and player versus environment (PVE) content. Raids fall under PVE content and consist of a group of 6 people completeing objectives to defeat a boss. My experience with these raids are lots of excitement and lots of anxiety. The raid that I will be talking about is the Scourge of the Past raid. If you want more information about the raid's specifics, there are many more detailed guides on youtube.

## Learning How to Raid

When we first were doing this raid it was a lot to take in. There were multiple encounters requiring everyone to listen to the leader. It really taught me and my friends the unfortunate parts that come with not listening. If we fail the kill the correct enemy or put the orb in the right place then we wipe which means that we all die and are forced to redo the encounter. The first time doing the raid, half of my group knew how to do the raid and were the instructors and the other half (which is where I was) did not know how to do it. We failed many times, but eventually pulled through. It really taught me that I need to follow instructions or else my group suffers for my mistake. It was still fun to do and I even got a weapon that was really useful.

## Teaching How to Raid

Learning and teaching are two different things. When I was the raid leader, my group again was half and half on who knew how to do the raid. I had to learn how to be calm when someone made a mistake because otherwise they might get a bad impression about raiding in general. Teaching people how to raid was a good lesson on how to keep calm when around people who don't know better. It also helped me to be a leader and take charge in the event someone messed up. 

## The Aftermath

Raiding in Destiny 2 requires everyone to work together and understanding that people will mess up. It is fun to do, yet can be really stressful if your group keeps failing the same encounter. I still enjoy teaching and learning about the new upcoming raids in Destiny 2 as well as other games. The raids taught me about how important it is to communicate effectively.
