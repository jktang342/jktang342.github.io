summary: My experience learning to play the ukulele and why it made me more confident.
---

I learned how to play the ukulele when I was a child and although I don't take lessons anymore I would say that they still taught me a few lessons in life. I first started learning because my mom really wanted me to learn how to play a musical instrument. She really wanted me to play the flute, but I chose the ukulele instead. Learning how to play it for the first time was not as hard as I thought it was going to be, it was lots of memorization of hand placement on the neck of the ukulele. My fingers at first would have a hard time since it wasn't used to strumming and picking the strings, but it got easier over time.

## Being On Stage

I am a very shy and quiet person, but while taking lessons I would have to ocassionally go and play in public for the class. I remember going to Ala Moana to play with the other students in the class and I was very nervous, but when I started playing I found myself not feeling as nervous. I was just enjoying playing the ukulele. That day I found that it's not so scary when you enjoy doing what you are doing. Even though I don't take lessons anymore, I still remember how to play and it makes me happy to play it when I'm feeling stressed or anxious. Even though I was at first forced to learn it, I appreciate that I got to learn how to play it and how to be more confident in what I do.
